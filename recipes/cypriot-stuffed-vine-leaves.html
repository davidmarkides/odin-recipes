        <h1>How to stuff vine leaves, the Cypriot way!</h1>
        <p>
          Wash the fresh vine leaves and blanch them for 5 minutes. Add cold
          water and drain. If using jarred brined grape leaves, wash, rinse and
          drain them.
        </p>
        <p>
          In a skillet heat half of the olive oil and sauté the onion until
          translucent. Add the ground meat and sauté until it turns white. Add
          half of the tomato and half of the lemon juice and cook for 5 minutes
          stirring once in a while.
        </p>
        <p>Mix in the remaining ingredients and set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>
          Put a leaf on a plate, vein side facing up, remove stem and put about
          a tbsp of the mixture near the stem.
        </p>
        <p>
          Neatly fold left edge and then right edge and then roll all the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wrap up into a cigar shape (don’t fold too tight as the rice will
          expand during cooking).
        </p>
        <p>Repeat with the remaining grape leaves and filling.</p>
        <p>
          Place neatly in the pot seam side facing down, starting from the edge,
          moving in a circle towards the centre. Second and third layers may be
          placed on top.
        </p>
        <p>
          Add the remaining tomato, olive oil as well as lemon juice and then
          cover them with a plate (which must be about the size of the pot).
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally add water to cover the plate and bring to a boil, Cover with
          the lid, reduce heat and simmer for about 30 - 35 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>Allow to rest for a while before serving.</p>
        <p>Serve with Greek yoghurt.</p>
